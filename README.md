Hello fellow coders,

My name is Dan and I am a Linux enthusiast who wants to learn how to be a developer. 
I decided to choose the name Beirut based on a meme I saw about Linux (Be Root).
Thank you for viewing my complex and intricate code (sarcasm detected) and I am excited to enter this community.

Happy coding...
